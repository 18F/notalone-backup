## Recent Announcements

On January 20, 2016, the Department of Justice’s Bureau of Justice Statistics [presented the results of a nine-school pilot test that was conducted to develop a campus climate survey](http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/ccsvsftr.pdf) that collects school-level data on sexual victimization of undergraduate students. The report describes the development of the survey instrument and procedures for data collection, nonresponse bias analysis, weighting, and validity assessment. It presents estimates for each school on the prevalence and incidence of sexual assault, rape, and sexual battery during the 2014–15 academic year, as well as characteristics of the victims and incidents. It also provides estimates of the prevalence of sexual assault since entering college and during the student's lifetime. In addition, the report examines the relationship between measures of campus climate and rates of sexual victimization. [The full survey instrument is available here.](/assets/RevisedInstrumentModules_1_21_16_cleanCombined_psg.pdf)

[2014 Clery Act Data is now available here](/data/#clery-act-data) from the Department of Education. It includes, for the first time, the name and contact information for each institution’s lead Title IX coordinator.

Valerie Jarrett wrote a blog for Yahoo! Parenting on October 9, 2015 to help prospective students and parents, as they visit colleges, to navigate the sexual assault policies, procedures, and resources available on campus. [Read the blog post, “Four Critical Questions for the College Search.”](https://www.notalone.gov/assets/4-questions-you-should-ask.pdf)

On September 17, 2015, we released a [Resource Guide](https://www.notalone.gov/assets/task-force-resource-guide-sep-15.pdf) to support the efforts of students, faculty, administrators, and communities around the country to prevent and improve the response to sexual violence at colleges and universities. This guide includes links to documents, guidance, and tools from the task force and other advocacy groups.

## About Notalone.gov

NotAlone.gov includes information for students, schools, and anyone interested in finding resources on how to respond to and prevent sexual assault.

Click below to find a crisis service, learn more about students' rights, identify schools' obligations to protect students from sexual assault, understand how to file a complaint with the federal government, and view a map of resolved school-level enforcement activities.

Throughout this website the term, “school” refers to all public educational institutions and all schools that receive federal funds, including elementary and secondary schools (both traditional and charter), school districts, colleges, and universities. Sections of the website that are only applicable at the postsecondary or elementary and secondary school level add clarifying information.

NotAlone was launched in connection with the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault. The Task Force was established on January 22, 2014 – and since then, thousands of people have shared their stories and ideas about how best to eliminate sexual assault in schools. [On April 29, 2014, we released our first report, which can be viewed here](https://www.notalone.gov/assets/report.pdf).
